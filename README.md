## Concept
Overload Station is a VR project that reimagines the concept of
virtual auditoria as an immersive, introspective art installation. It
invites users on a singular journey through music and digital spatial
immersion, fostering deep reflection on our future within the
information overload era. The experience is powered by a custom
15-minute soundtrack, integrating sound effects to enhance spatial
realism. It also features curated 1980s videos that resonate with
current issues of AI and information overload, deepening immersion
through a concept of secondary immersion.

### Attention is the new oil
Overload Station explores the commodification of attention in the
digital age, examining how technologies captivate us. It questions
our ability to resist addiction to virtual realities, amplified by VR and
AR, when we're already trapped by our screens. This installation
both celebrates potential digital futures and encourages a critical
look at our tech dependencies.

## How to?
Upon wearing the VR headset, users find themselves inside
Overload Station, greeted by a TV displaying the first of 12 introspective
videos. Advancing upstairs to the main platform
triggers the start of a musical spectacle that transforms the
environment. The ocean morphs into visual sound waves,
echoing the station's broadcast. Users are encouraged to
explore Overload Station, letting their curiosity lead them
through this immersive, auditory, and visual journey.
